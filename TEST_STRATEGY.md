# 🧪 Comprehensive Test Strategy for User Management System

## 📌 Overview

This test strategy outlines the overall approach, tools, coverage, and execution procedures for validating a **User Management System** that features:
- REST API for user CRUD operations
- Web interface for user management
- Real-time notifications
- Multi-tenant data isolation

The testing efforts span across **API Testing**, **UI Automation**, **Performance Testing**, and **Security Testing** to ensure reliability, scalability, and security.

## 🛠️ Tools & Frameworks Used

| Area | Tool/Framework | Purpose |
|------|----------------|---------|
| API Testing | `pytest`, `requests`, `jsonschema` | Functional & security validation |
| UI Testing | `Selenium`, `pytest`, `ChromeDriver` | Automated browser-based tests |
| Performance | `Locust` | Load and stress testing |
| Security | `pytest`, `requests`, manual payloads | Vulnerability checks (XSS, SQLi, AuthZ) |
| Utilities | `Faker`, `json`, `custom data generators` | Mock/test data and helpers |
